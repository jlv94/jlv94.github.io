                            <br>
                            <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan! Thank you for your interest!</p>
                            <p>After relocating to Vancouver Island from Belgium in spring 2023, I wanted to continue living by my passion: leveraging data and marketing technics to help organizations gain more customers-value by enhancing their performance, efficency and level of execution.</p>
                            <p>I graduated with Great Honour from a Master's in Business Engineering, focusing on data analytics from Brussels Management School of Business. I've gained extensive and practical knowledge in E-Commerce and Data Analytics, through various roles in Europe and Canada. I enjoy cooking, baking, and exploring the  outdoors of Beautiful British Columbia.</p>
